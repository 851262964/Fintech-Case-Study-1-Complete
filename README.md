## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Bridge financing for Real Estate that is collateralized by way of Inter Alia charge against both the property being sold, as well as the property being purchased.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
A - highly securitized lending with multiple default recourse. These loans are typically less then 90 days which allows for multiple capital re-deployment opportunities that would allow for greater ROR when compounded on an annual basis.

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
A - Existing tech platforms could be utilized in theory, and therefore there should/would minimal cost impact that would allow for this financial product offering to be put to market relatively quickly.

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
A - The same application process similar to that of a regular mortgage could be used, existing credit reports referenced to establish credit worthiness, and existing adjudication processes/programs followed to approve the bridge loan application.  The only change in process, in theory, would be when the file gets to the lawyer.  The lawyer would be registering a principle secondary charge against the property being purchased, and a secondary charge on the property that has been sold.
